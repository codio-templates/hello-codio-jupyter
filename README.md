# Getting started
This is a guide on how to get Jupyter up and running on Codio, as well as how to create auto-graded assignments. **Note**, this is not a tutorial on how to use Jupyter notebooks themselves.

## Staring the Jupyter Server
The Jupyter stacks on Codio all start the Jupyter Notebook server when the project loads.

## Viewing the Notebooks
To view the notebooks, click the button above `Show Notebooks` to open a new tab in Codio with all of the Jupyter notebooks associated with this project.

## Content

Once you start the Jupyter server, it displays first, then the Jupyter notebooks in alphabetical order, finally it displays any other files in alphabetical order. Preface the notebook titles with a number to give them a custom order.

- **Example Lesson** - This is a good place to start to see what a lesson in Jupyter notebooks could look like.
- **Setting Up Codio** - Here are the steps needed to create a project based on the Jupyter and nbgrader stack. This notebook also has instructions on setting up the buttons to start the Jupyter server and open the notebooks.
- **Code Visualizer** - Instructions on how to add a code visualizer to the lesson if you want students to have access to this tool.
- **NBGrader** - This section talks about what is needed to setup Jupyter notebooks to auto-grade or manually grade cells. Other topics include partial points, hidden tests, and read-only cells.
